# Visualization of TA-DARTS    

> All informations including accuracies, alpha and beta parameters were recorded during searching, training and testing.
> All the data will be saved in "log.txt" file in "search0" or in an experiment folder in "exp" directory.
> We visualized the data to see the progress clearly.
> Scripts here are made to visualize the data and belows are the examples of the results.
